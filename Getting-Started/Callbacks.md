# Callbacks 
callbacks are must concept for node
to put it simply callbacks are just functions that is passed to another function as an argument. 

## Anonymous Functions 
-> they are not named
-> they can be assigned to variables 
-> when assigned to a variable they show up in stack trace 
-> They may show up as 'anonymous function' in stack traces when passed into other functions as callbacks, however.

Anonymous functions are mostly used by passing them into other functions as a callback. This will become more clear later.

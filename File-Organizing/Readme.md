For any Project file organizing effectively is crucial for scalability and maintainability. 

# Flow

Client Request ---> app.js (Middleware applied) ---> Routes ---> Middleware ---> Controller ---> Model ---> Database Query ---> Controller Sends Response ---> Client Receives Response

main job of controller => Handling Business Logic 
main job of middleware => Request Parsing, Authentication, Validation 


1. Client Request
    GET /api/users

2. app.js (Global Middleware)
    - json body parsing
    - url encoding 
    - global error handling 
    - cors policies

3. Routes
    - /some-path/subpath

4. Middleware
    - authentication 
    - validation 
    - etc
5. Controller
    - business logic 

6. Model & Database Query
7. Controller Sends Response
8. client Receives Response

### Detail File structure 


1. config/ => store file configuration like (database settings , environment variables )

2. controllers/ => contains route handler functions. Each file typically corresponds to resource or feature. 

3. middlewares/ => Custom middleware for things like authentication, logging error handling. 

4. models/ => Database models, such as Mongoose or Sequelize models. 

5. routes/ => define application routes and associate them with controller functions 

6. services/ => Business Logic, such as complex operations, third party api calls reusable logic 

7. utils/ =>  Helper functions or utilities that are reusable across the project (e.g., formatting dates, generating tokens).

8. validators/ => Request Validation logic, such as using express-validators or other libraries to validate and sanitize inputs 

## Other files 

- app.js => initialize express app, set up middleware and load routes

- server.js => responsible for starting the server and setting up any environment-specific settings 

- .env => env config for sensitive data like api keys database urls
